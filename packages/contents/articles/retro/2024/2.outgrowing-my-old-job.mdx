2024 was the year I finally admitted it to myself: my old company wasn't the problem, it just wasn't the right fit for who I was becoming. I had outgrown the role, the pace, and the way things were done there. 

Instead of complaining, I decided to shift my focus inward — to study properly, to stop half-learning, and to pour my energy into personal projects. The first real result of that decision was my original personal blog, a tiny website that somehow opened the door to my current job and eventually evolved into this version 2 you're reading now. It wasn't a clean break or a heroic moment, just a quiet decision to take myself more seriously.
