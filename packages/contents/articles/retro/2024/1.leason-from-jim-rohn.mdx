In 2024, Jim Rohn's line finally hit me for real:

<RoughMark type="highlight" multiline color="#ffe066"><span style={{ color: '#000' }}>Learn to work harder on yourself than you do on your job. If you work hard on your job you can make a living, but if you work hard on yourself you'll make a fortune.</span></RoughMark>

Until then, I mostly treated "self-improvement" like a nice-to-have, something I'd do when I had time. This was the year I started to see my mind, my skills, and my habits as the real assets — not the job title on my profile. It changed how I spent my evenings, what I paid attention to, and what I expected from my future self.
