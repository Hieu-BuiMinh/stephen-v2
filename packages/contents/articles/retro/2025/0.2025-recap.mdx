Looking back at 2025, it's been a year of transformation in so many ways. This was the year I truly embraced the mindset of

> Focus on yourself

and as I reflect on the past months, I realize just how much I've grown, both personally and professionally. It's been a year of steady progress, building upon the hard work I put in during 2024, and while not everything went perfectly, I'm proud of what I've achieved.

A major highlight of this year was starting a new job at a new company. It was a huge change, and one that brought its fair share of challenges. However, it's been such a rewarding experience. I've learned so much already, and I'm excited to see where this journey will take me. It's been a refreshing change that's pushed me to grow in ways I didn't expect, and I'm really looking forward to what's to come.

This year, I also made a conscious effort to travel more. I visited Binh Hung Island and Da Lat, and both trips gave me the chance to slow down, enjoy new experiences, and recharge my batteries. There's something about stepping away from the daily grind and immersing yourself in nature that brings so much clarity. These trips reminded me to appreciate the simple things, and I came back feeling more grounded and inspired.

One of the most exciting personal projects this year was launching my new blog. It was something I'd been wanting to do for a long time, and finally taking the leap felt like a huge step forward. While the blog is still in its early stages, I'm proud of the progress I've made. It's been a platform for self-expression, a place where I can share my thoughts and experiences. I look forward to growing it even more in the future.

But of course, it hasn't been all smooth sailing. There are areas where I still need to improve. For instance, I struggled with commitment in some areas. There were several projects I started but didn't finish, and I didn't read as many books as I had hoped. I still have a lot to work on, but that's okay. It's part of the process.

One thing I'm particularly proud of this year is my commitment to fitness. I made it a point to go to the gym consistently, and I'm happy to say I stuck to it. I've noticed a huge difference in my energy levels, my mindset, and even my mood. Regular exercise has become a key part of my routine, and it's something I plan to continue as part of my self-care.

Looking ahead, I have a clear goal for 2026 🎯

> Finish what you started

I want to close the chapters that are still open, finish the projects that have been left incomplete, and clean up the loose ends. I want to make 2026 a year of completion and clarity, so I can enter 2027 with a fresh perspective and a solid foundation.

2025 has been a year of progress—personally, professionally, and physically. I've focused on myself, reflected on where I am, and made plans for the future. I'm excited for the year ahead, and I'm ready to finish strong and make 2026 even better. Here's to building on everything I've started and embracing the next chapter of growth!
