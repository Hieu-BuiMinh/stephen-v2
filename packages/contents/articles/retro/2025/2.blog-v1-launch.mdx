By August 2025, it felt like I had outgrown my first blog, so I decided to rebuild it from the ground up. Blog v2 wasn’t just a redesign; it was a reset of tone, structure, and intention—a place that felt closer to who I had become and where I wanted to go next. This version is where all the threads meet: past lessons, current projects, and the stories I’m still in the middle of writing.
