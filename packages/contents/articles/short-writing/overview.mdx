<AnimatedBlock type="FADE_IN_FROM_BOTTOM">

**Hello! Welcome to my website üëã**

</AnimatedBlock>

<AnimatedBlock type="FADE_IN_FROM_BOTTOM" delay={0.2}>

    The Second Version of my own website was created in 2024. I was learning how to build a blog with Next.js back then. The old version is actually open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/Hieu-BuiMinh/portfolio-blog-webapp). If you're interested in seeing how I structure my website and the technologies behind it feel free to check it out. The only difference with the current version is the designs.

    In 2025, I decided to revamp this website with a new, awesome design and subtle animations, which were designed by my [ME](https://github.com/Hieu-BuiMinh). With the new design, I can showcase my latest front-end development skills.
