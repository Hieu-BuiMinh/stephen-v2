**ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my website**

This is the second version of my personal website, launched in 2025 after lots of learning, experimenting, and refining. Compared to the very [first version](https://github.com/Hieu-BuiMinh/portfolio-blog-webapp) (built in 2024), this upgrade brings:

- Built with Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS 4, and Turborepo ðŸš€.
- A cleaner, modern design with improved aesthetics.
- Subtle animations for a smoother, more engaging experience.
- Better performance and responsiveness, making the site faster on any device.

My goal with this revamp is to turn this website into a personal space where [I](https://github.com/Hieu-BuiMinh) can share projects, blog posts, and my journey as a developer.
