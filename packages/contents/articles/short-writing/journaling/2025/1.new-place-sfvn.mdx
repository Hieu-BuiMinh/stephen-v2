Leaving a familiar environment is never easy. Comfort has a way of disguising stagnation. For a while, I stayed because it felt safe. But safety, without growth, eventually becomes a limitation.

What pushed me forward was a simple question I kept returning to:

<RoughMark type="underline" color="#ff922b">
	{' '}
	<span>Am I becoming the person I want to be here?</span>{' '}
</RoughMark>

The honest answer was no.

At some point, a thought became clear to me:

<RoughMark type="highlight" color="#ffe066">
	<span style={{ color: '#000', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>"The seat is already there. You decide whether you fit."</span>
</RoughMark>

This move is not about running away from the past. It is about choosing myself—my focus, my standards, and my long-term direction. I wanted a space where learning feels natural again, where challenges are meaningful, and where effort compounds instead of drains.

I do not see this place as where I will stay forever.
But being able to sit in this role today—and earn an income that feels right for where I am in life—is the result of consistent effort and persistence on my part.

It came from choosing to focus on myself. Improving my skills, refining my mindset, and staying disciplined even when progress felt slow. That focus aligns exactly with my personal slogan for this year: focus on myself.

Looking back now, I believe the effort has been rewarded in a way that feels fair and well-earned.

Starting at a new company on the first day of May feels symbolic. A new month. A new rhythm. A new mindset. I am entering this chapter with humility, curiosity, and a renewed sense of responsibility for my own growth.

I do not expect everything to be easy. In fact, I hope it won't be. Growth rarely comes from comfort. What I do expect is alignment—between how I think, how I work, and where I am heading.

This is a reset.
A conscious decision to focus inward, work with intention, and move forward without rushing.

- Here's to learning again.
- Here's to discomfort that leads somewhere.
- Here's to a new journey—one chosen deliberately.
