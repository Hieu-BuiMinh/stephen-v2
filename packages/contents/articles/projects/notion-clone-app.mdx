## Notion Clone App 📚

Notion - [https://notion-clone-app-xii.vercel.app/](https://notion-clone-app-xii.vercel.app/)

This project is a simplified clone of the popular productivity application, Notion. It replicates some of Notion's core features, offering a platform where users can create, edit, and organize their notes in a flexible and intuitive interface.

The backend is powered by Convex, a real-time database that enables instant data updates. Additionally, Edgestore, a distributed key-value store, manages the images and files uploaded by users. User authentication is handled securely and efficiently by Clerk, a scalable authentication API.
