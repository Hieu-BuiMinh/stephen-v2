My personal website and blog.

I've come across countless blogs on the Internet, and I've always dreamed of creating my own—where I can write about anything, whether it's tutorials, notes, or personal reflections. That's why I decided to start learning web development in December 2020. I began with the basics: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and quickly realized that creating a static website wasn't enough for me. I wanted more flexibility and interactivity.

After a year of learning, I expanded my skills to include React.js and Next.js. These technologies allowed me to build dynamic, scalable websites and gave me the tools to create a blog that could evolve alongside my ideas. I'm excited to continue this journey, exploring new technologies and creating content that reflects my growth as both a developer and a creator.

## Core Technologies

- Next.js 15 with App Router 🚦
- TypeScript with strict configuration 🚧
- Tailwind CSS for styling ✨
- Velite - MDX for content ✏️
- Real-time database 🔗
